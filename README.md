# Glowing Tools Forge
A Minecraft mod to illuminate your experience while mining, without having to unequip your shield! 

## Instructions

1. Acquire any compatible tool (any vanilla tool)
2. Craft a torch
3. Combine the torch with the tool in the crafting grid to get a glowing tool!
4. Glowing diamond tools can be upgraded to glowing netherite tools in the smithing table
5. Durability, enchantments etc. work exactly as on their vanilla counterpart

## Known Issues

- Durability and enchantments get reset on craft
- Legacy items look like normal tools because of the durability bar. (Won't fix)
- Torches only placeable on solid blocks (expected behavior for now) 

## Translations

Currently translated:

- English (US)
- Lolcat

## Requirements

## Legacy Textures

There is a legacy resource pack included, if you prefer a rather subtle texture instead of a torch on the tool.
